1) The chart labels are presented in Portuguese. Thus, the x axis can be translated into English in number of generations 
and the y axis in the value of the best individual/solution.

2) The file name "albano_[5000, 0.3, 0.1]1", for example, represents : A_[B]C
    A - instance name
    B - BRKGA parameters
    C - execution number
